 **This is where I started my portfolio building when taking a data analysis class on incubator hub**

**I have learnt quite a number of things ranging from Ms Excel to SQL and now in portfolio building**

## project topic: E commerce salse Analysis

### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the sales data from an e-commerce business over the last year to uncover valuable insights. By studying various aspects of the data, we aim to generate a clear understanding that can guide strategic decisions and allow us to effectively communicate patterns, trends, and performance outcomes from the data.

### Data Source
This project utilizes "Data Sale.csv" as its primary data source. The dataset is openly accessible and can be downloaded from reputable open data platforms such as Kaggle, FRED, or similar data-sharing websites.

### Tools Used
- MS Excel For cleaning and organizing data [Download here](https://www.Microsoft.com)
   - for data collection
   - for data cleaning
      1. Data manipulation
      2. Data munching 
- SQL Server (For data querying and analysis)  
- Power BI (For visualizing and reporting insights)  
- MS PowerPoint (For final project presentation)

### Data cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning and preparation stage includes:  
1. Importing the data and reviewing its structure  
2. Managing any missing or incomplete values  
3. Formatting and cleaning the data to ensure consistency and readiness for analysis

### Exploratory Data Analysis  
During EDA, we analyzed the data to uncover insights, including:  
- Identifying overall sales patterns  
- Determining best-selling products  
- Finding products with the highest sales peaks

Data Analysis  
Here, we present essential code examples, queries, or DAX formulas applied throughout the data analysis to derive meaningful insights.

 ``` SQL
alter table employee
add state_of_ origin varchar(100)
select a,b,c
where a>= 45
```
